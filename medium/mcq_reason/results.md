## MTLLM (using OpenAI)
### Overall Output
```yaml
[Reasoning] If Sept. 1st, 2021 was a week ago, then today is Sept. 8th, 2021. The date 10 days ago from Sept. 8th, 2021 is Aug. 29th, 2021.
[Output] A

## LMQL (using OpenAI)
### Overall Output
```yaml
1. We know that it was Sept. 1st, 2021 a week ago.
2. So, 10 days ago would be Sept. 1st, 2021 - 10 days = Aug. 22nd, 2021.
3. The date format is MM/DD/YYYY, so the answer would be 08/22/2021.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 08/29/2021.

## DSpy (using OpenAI)
### Overall Output
```yaml
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that today is September 8th, 2021 because it was September 1st, 2021 a week ago. To find the date 10 days ago from today, we need to subtract 10 days from September 8th, 2021.
1. Start from September 8th, 2021.
2. Subtract 8 days to reach September 1st, 2021.
3. Subtract 2 more days to reach August 30th, 2021.
Therefore, the date 10 days ago from today is August 29th, 2021. (A) 08/29
```

## Observations
1. The MTLLM model was able to provide the correct answer in a shorter time compared to the other models.
