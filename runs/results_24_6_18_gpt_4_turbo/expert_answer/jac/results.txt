Output:
 [Output] Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to predict and generate text based on the input they receive. LLMs are capable of performing a variety of language-based tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering, making them powerful tools in AI research and application.
