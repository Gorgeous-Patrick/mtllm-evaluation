model_used: gpt-4o
mtllm_max_token = 1024 (default)
mtllm_temperature = 0.7 (default)
dspy_max_token = 1024 on level generation, rest kept the default value (150)
dspy_temperature = 0.0 (default)

Experimentation
- Checking whether not providing Semstring to MTLLM reduced the results quality.

Jac implementations
- No Semstring were used. Function names were changed to adhere to additional information

Conclusion
- Even without Semstring (with additional function name changes on some occasions) Jac implementations ran smoothly and was 
able to get desired outputs for harder problems such as wikipedia(ReACT implementation), Level Generation (Following Nested Types)
etc.
- Jaclang's way of providing direct typing hints (input and outputs) allowed models to correctly understand the desired outputs
this can be seen evidently in the odd word out problem where even the examples is a list of list[str], str, str and the desired
output is typed list[str, str], it was able to not repeat the list[str] portion.
