To solve the problem:
1. Determine the reference date from the question, which is "Sept. 1st, 2021".
2. Calculate the date "10 days ago" from the reference date.
3. Match the calculated date with the choices provided.

Step-by-step calculation:
- Reference date: September 1, 2021.
- 10 days ago from September 1, 2021, is August 22, 2021.
- Convert "August 22, 2021" to MM/DD/YYYY format, resulting in "08/22/2021".
- Check the choices for a match. However, none of the choices match "08/22/2021". It seems there might be an issue with the choices or the question's interpretation.

[Output] None of the provided choices match the correct date of "08/22/2021".
