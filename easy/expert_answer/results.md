## MTLLM (using Anthropic - Claude3 Sonnet)
### Overall Output
```yaml
AI/ML Researcher or Natural Language Processing Engineer says: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They leverage deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to capture complex patterns and relationships in text. LLMs can perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as question answering, text summarization, translation, and even creative writing. However, their outputs can be biased or inconsistent, and they may generate harmful or untruthful content, so careful monitoring and responsible deployment are essential.'

## LMQL (using OpenAI)
### Overall Output
```yaml
 a computer scientist or linguist who specializes in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) says:  this question by saying:

Large language models are computer programs that use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to process and generate human language.

## DSpy (using OpenAI)
### Overall Output
```yaml
Natural Language Processing Expert says: Expert's answer: Large Language Models are a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on vast amounts of text data in order to understand and generate human language. These models are capable of performing a wide range of language-related tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more. Some popular examples of large language models include GPT-3 and BERT.

## Observations
1. MTLLM Provided the most detailed and accurate answer to the question. and no unwanted words were added.
2. DSpy also provided accurate answer but additional unwanted word `Expert's answer:` was added.
3. LMQL provided a short and accurate answer but it was not as detailed and at the sametime introduced some unwanted words `this question by saying:` and additional newline.
4. MTLLM & LMQL took almost same time to generate the answer but DSpy took less time to generate the answer.
