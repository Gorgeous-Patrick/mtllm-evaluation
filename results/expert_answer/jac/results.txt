Output:
 [Output] Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on large datasets they were trained on. They leverage deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks with many parameters, to predict and generate coherent text. Examples include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. LLMs can perform various language tasks such as translation, summarization, question-answering, and more, by learning patterns and nuances in human language.
